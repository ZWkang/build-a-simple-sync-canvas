# Domain Docs

This repository uses a single-context domain-doc layout. Domain vocabulary lives in `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, and architecture decisions live under `docs/adr/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If either location doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence or suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill—reached through `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`—creates these files lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the required concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether the output is inventing language the project doesn't use. If it represents a real gap, record it for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly instead of silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
